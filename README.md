I was thinking that this project will be sent as ".zip" but after all i knew you forbid external files
, i know it's not a good practice to send it as one commit , so i wrote this short read me to explain my choice.

- The whole project was made in "TDD"
- I created a utility class named "MonetaryFormat" to be used frontend side.

Bank account kata

Think of your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

Requirements

·         Deposit and Withdrawal

·         account statement (date, amount, balance)

·         Statement printing

The expected result is a service API, and its underlying implementation, that meets the expressed needs.
Nothing more, especially no UI, no persistence.
